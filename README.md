# cleanerpostgazette
A Tapermonkey/Greasemonkey Script to Make Pittsburgh Post Gazette more bearable.

This only works as per the code of the Post Gazette on the day of the commit.

Not trying to get too crazy here, as I realize that ad revenue is important to Newspaper providers.  But as a subscriber, I find a lot of these ads just flat out intrusive to trying to read anything on the site.  

NOTE: Post-Gazette you really need an overhaul of all of your code, site performance and many other things.  You code is not just buggy, but is really, really bad.  Whomeever is in charge of your code should be ashamed of themselves.
