# cleanerpostgazette
A Tapermonkey/Greasemonkey Script to Make Pittsburgh Post Gazette more bearable.

This only works as per the code of the Post Gazette on the day of the commit.

This script will:

* Remove the Google Ad that appears at the very top of homepage and all article pages
* Remove all Comments
* Remove the god-awful Civic Science Polls
* Remove the "Sponsored Content" blocks that serve up weekly-world news type articles.

I'll adjust this as necessary when other items pop up that annoy me.

Not trying to get too crazy here, as I realize that ad revenue is important to Newspaper providers.  But as a subscriber, I find a lot of these ads just flat out intrusive to trying to read anything on the site.  

NOTE: Post-Gazette you really need an overhaul of all of your code, site performance and many other things.  You code is not just buggy, but is really, really bad.  Whomeever is in charge of your code should be ashamed of themselves.
